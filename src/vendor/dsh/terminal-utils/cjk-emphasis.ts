/**
 * CJK-adjacent strong emphasis for the shared `marked` instance.
 *
 * CommonMark cannot close `**label：**text` in CJK prose: the closing
 * delimiter run must be right-flanking, and a run preceded by a punctuation
 * mark (the fullwidth colon/period/quote that ends a Chinese label) only
 * qualifies when whitespace or more punctuation follows. Chinese does not
 * space after punctuation, so the exact shape models write for emphasis
 * labels — `**证据与影响：**源码中…` — keeps literal asterisks on GitHub and
 * every strict CommonMark renderer alike.
 *
 * The tokenizer below takes over exactly that shape: a `**` pair whose body
 * ends with a Unicode punctuation mark and whose closer is immediately
 * followed by a CJK ideograph, kana, hangul syllable or fullwidth form. Every
 * other case is declined, so the built-in em tokenizer keeps its behavior —
 * including the ASCII one (`**note:**see`), which stays literal to stay
 * consistent with GitHub.
 *
 * Deliberately left literal (same gap upstream, rarer):
 * - `***` triple runs (em+strong) and single-`*` emphasis;
 * - bodies containing a backtick, where the pair could straddle a code span
 *   (the math tokenizer guards `$` bodies the same way).
 *
 * Vendored from dsh-TUI 52f4f50b (fix(markdown): close CJK-adjacent strong
 * emphasis).
