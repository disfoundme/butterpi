/**
 * Cross-process session mounting ledger, kept at
 * `~/.butterpi/session-mounts.json`.
 *
 * A TUI terminal hosts SEVERAL agent sessions at once (the attached one plus
 * every parked background session), and sessions are durable: another TUI, or
 * `dsh web`, can list the same logs. Nothing in the DSH session store says
 * *who is currently driving a log*, so two TUI processes resuming the same
 * session would interleave writes into one append-only event log and corrupt
 * the transcript. This file is that missing fact: each TUI process publishes
 * the set of sessions it has mounted, and a reader that sees a foreign entry
 * treats the session as OCCUPIED and refuses to mount it.
 *
 * Liveness is one witness, `process.kill(pid, 0)`: it catches a clean exit and
 * a `kill -9`. There is no heartbeat timestamp, because a timestamp only stays
 * truthful while a timer keeps refreshing it, and the process that cannot
 * refresh it is exactly the one whose record should expire. The cost is pid
 * REUSE — a recycled pid keeps a dead owner's record alive — which errs toward
 * refusing a session that is in fact free and costs one restart; the opposite
 * error interleaves two writers into one transcript. This is a same-machine
 * guard only: the host's own session write lock stays the authority that
 * actually separates writers.
 *
 * Reads never write. Pruning a dead owner happens on the write path, because a
 * reader that wrote its snapshot back could erase a peer's record published
 * between its read and its replace — silently dropping a live session from the
 * occupancy table while its process kept writing.
 *
 * Writes take a short cross-process lock, re-read the file under it, and replace
 * it atomically. The lock is token-checked, so a holder whose lock was reclaimed
 * as stale cannot write over — or delete — the new holder's lock. A CLAIM
 * re-derives its conflict under that lock ({@link claimMount}), because
 * "check, then publish" is not atomic across processes.
 *
 * "I could not read the ledger" is NOT "nobody holds the session". Granting a
 * write handle on a damaged or unreadable ledger is exactly the failure this
 * module exists to prevent, and it is unrecoverable, so the authoritative
 * paths refuse instead of degrading ({@link readMountLedgerStrict},
 * {@link MountFailure}). Only the display surface reads best-effort.
 *
 * The lock is reclaimable only from a holder that is provably gone: its token
 * carries the holder pid, so a lock whose holder is still ALIVE is never stolen
 * from — not even by a peer that finds it old. That closes the window where a
 * paused holder resumed after its lock had been reclaimed and committed a
 * snapshot derived before the steal. The price is pid REUSE on a lock: a
 * recycled pid keeps a dead holder's lock alive, and the remedy is to delete
 * `session-mounts.lock` while every process sharing this data directory is
 * stopped.
