/**
 * IDE selection channel (PR-B groundwork): the dsh-tui side of a loopback
 * WebSocket link with a companion IDE extension (dsh-tui-vscode). The
 * extension broadcasts caret-selection changes; the TUI consumes them to
 * attach `<attached-file …>` blocks at submit time (ADR-001).
 *
 * Discovery has two paths (DESIGN D4):
 *   1. env direct — DSH_TUI_IDE_PORT + DSH_TUI_IDE_TOKEN, injected when the
 *      extension spawns this TUI itself;
 *   2. lock scan — `~/.butterpi/ide/*.lock` files written by the extension
 *      ({port, token, workspaceFolders, pid}); locks whose workspaceFolders
 *      match the session cwd connect first.
 *
 * Both paths fail → silent degradation (AC-4): no error, no retry,
 * connected=false, every other TUI feature unaffected. The client is Node's
 * native WebSocket global (engines ^22.19 || >=24, D5) — zero dependencies
 * and no auto-reconnect (degrade-on-drop is the design).
 *
 * Protocol constants here are a cross-repo contract (the extension's server
 * side implements the mirror); changing them requires updating both ends
 * plus ADR-001 (DESIGN §9.5). Protocol version 2:
 * - Handshake: the client's first frame is
 *   `{"method":"ide/hello","params":{"token","protocolVersion"}}`; the
 *   server validates the token and answers
 *   `{"method":"ide/hello_ack","params":{"protocolVersion",
 *   "workspaceFolders"}}`. The client is connected only after a valid ack —
 *   a wrong token closes the socket and the client tries its next
 *   candidate.
 * - Notifications: `{"method":"selection_changed","params":{path,
 *   startLine, endLine, isEmpty, text, documentVersion}}` — coordinates are
 *   0-based, and `text` carries the editor buffer's own selection text
 *   (unsaved edits included); the TUI attaches that text verbatim and only
 *   falls back to reading the file from disk for protocol-1 pushes.
