/**
 * Landing-screen preference for the TUI's workspace home screen.
 *
 * A one-key preference under `~/.butterpi/home.json`, deliberately NOT a cordis
 * config value: "has this installation shown the user the workspace home on a
 * fresh launch yet" is per-machine UI state, like the lang and tray
 * preferences next to it — not a deployment choice a cordis.yml row should own.
 *
 * The rule it enables is one-shot: the FIRST ordinary launch (no explicit
 * `--resume`, no workspace target) lands on the workspace home instead of a
 * blank conversation, because that is the launch where "which project am I
 * working on" has no answer yet. After that the chat screen is the landing
 * surface again, and the home screen stays reachable as a screen.
 *
 * A preference file that cannot be read or written is never fatal: the worst
 * outcome is one extra home screen, or a chat screen where the home was
 * expected. Both are recoverable with a single keypress.
 *
 * @module @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/homePrefs
